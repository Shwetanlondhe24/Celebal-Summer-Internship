## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional shipment tracking systems often lack comprehensive management capabilities and fail to provide role-specific interfaces for different stakeholders. Most existing solutions offer limited visibility into the delivery process and don't facilitate efficient communication between customers, couriers, and administrators. ShipTracker addresses these gaps by providing a unified platform that streamlines the entire shipment lifecycle from creation to delivery.

## 🏗️ Solution Approach

The solution implements a **multi-user architecture** that serves three distinct user types, each with tailored interfaces and functionalities:

### 👥 Multi-User System Architecture

The system serves **3 types of users**, each with specific goals and responsibilities:

#### 1. 🛍️ **Customers** - *Shipment Creators & Trackers*
**Primary Goal:** Create, manage, and track their shipments efficiently

**Why This Perspective:** Customers need an intuitive interface to manage their shipping needs without technical complexity, while having complete visibility into their shipment status.

#### 2. 🚚 **Couriers** - *Delivery Executors*
**Primary Goal:** Efficiently manage assigned deliveries and update shipment status

**Why This Perspective:** Couriers need a mobile-friendly interface focused on execution efficiency, with minimal data entry and maximum operational support.

#### 3. 👨‍💼 **Administrators** - *System Orchestrators*
**Primary Goal:** Oversee operations, manage assignments, and ensure system efficiency.

**Why This Perspective:** Administrators need a comprehensive control center with analytics and management tools to ensure smooth operations across the entire system.

### 🔄 **Inter-User Interactions:**
- **Customer → Admin:** Shipment requests flow to admin for courier assignment.
- **Admin → Courier:** Assignments are distributed based on capacity and location.
- **Courier → Customer:** Real-time updates and delivery confirmations.
- **All Users:** Shared tracking system provides transparency across all stakeholders.

---

### **Key Features:**
- 🎨 **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with seamless desktop experience.
- 🔐 **Role-Based Authentication:** Secure login system with role-specific redirects.
- 💳 **Payment Integration:** Mock payment system with comprehensive error handling.
- 📱 **Progressive Web App:** Optimized for mobile courier usage.
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard:** Comprehensive metrics and reporting.
